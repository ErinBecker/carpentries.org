A Member Organisation is an organisation which has made a commitment to the growth and spread of The Carpentries. Members receive priority access to [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) and guidance with capacity building at their organisation. With local Instructors, Member organisations can readily run low-cost local [workshops]((/workshops/)). Community-developed lessons enable our Instructors to globally share the effort for developing impactful lessons on technical topics. Memberships give The Carpentries revenue to ensure the ongoing development and maintenance of the lessons demanded by research communities. We also work to give your local Instructors support, mentorship, and a forum for community lesson development.

### Membership Tiers

We offer several levels of Memberships, based on training activities expected annually. Fees listed below are for not-for-profit organisations. We also provide memberships for for-profit organisations. Please [contact us](mailto:membership@carpentries.org) for more information.

#### Platinum Memberships

The Platinum tier is our most customizable membership. The price of a Platinum membership 
depends on the benefits selected from the options below. Many Platinum member organisations support individuals
at their institution in carrying out work to further The Carpentries mission in specific
ways. Organisations providing such in-kind services to The Carpentries are eligible
to receive a discount on their membership price, as detailed below.

<strong>Instructor Training</strong>
  * Instructor Training is a primary benefit of membership. Seats in Instructor Training are priced according to whether the training is
  coordinated by The Carpentries or internally by the member organisation. 
    * online, coordinated by The Carpentries = $1,000 each
    * online with one in-house Trainer, coordinated by The Carpentries = $750 each \*
    * online or in-person with in-house Trainers, coordinated by member organisation = $500 each \*

\* Only available to member organisations supporting Trainers.

Prices listed above apply to the first 15 seats in online Instructor Training or the first 30 seats in in-house Instructor Training.
We offer a 10% discount on additional seats, with a maximum total of 50 online seats, or 100 in-house seats.

<strong>Instructor Trainer Training</strong>
$10,000 

Workshops
Each Platinum membership includes 6 centrally-organised workshops. Instructor travel fees may apply and are the responsibility of the hosting organisation. 

#### Discounts
For each active Trainer who is supported by a member organisation in fulfilling their duties as laid out in the Trainer agreement (link), a $5,000 discount will be deducted from your membership price. This does not include potential future Trainers who will become Trainers during the membership year. 
If your organisation supports a Regional Coordinator (link to description), a $10,000 discount will be deducted from your membership price. The typical workload for a Regional Coordinator is 35 centrally-organised workshops per year (not including self-organised workshops). If workshop demand raises above that level, we may bring on a second Regional Coordinator in your region.
Community Lead


All benefits are subject to availability. Prices quoted are applicable only to not-for-profit institutions. 




#### Frequently Asked Questions

Please consult our [Membership FAQ page](/member_faq) for more information about memberships, technical workshops, and instructor training workshops.


#### Notes

Read more about how our workshops are run [here](/workshops/).

\* For Coordinated workshops, we will find instructors for the workshop, set up and handle registration, support instructor logistics and coordinate and share assessment results with the member organisation. A designated contact approves coordinated workshop requests for that organisation. Instructor travel expenses are the responsibility of the member and are not covered in membership fees.

\*\* For Self-organised workshops, the organisation is responsible for finding local Instructors and handling the logistics of workshop coordination, including registration and registering the workshop with Software, Data, and Library Carpentry. As long at least one Instructor is Carpentries-certified, and either the Software, Data, or Library Carpentry content is fully taught, the workshop can be labeled a Carpentries workshop.

\*\*\* Any Instructor training includes the instructor mentorship and support of the Instructors through the Instructor development program.

^ in-person instructor trainings require an available Trainer and travel funds to support Instructor Trainers' travel.

We are always interested in new members, and in participating in grants and other proposals. To reach us, or to
find out more, [please send us an email](mailto:memberships@carpentries.org).
